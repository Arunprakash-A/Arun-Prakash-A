## About me 
- I'm a deep learning researcher 🔭, currently working with transformer models.
- I use Pytorch 🔦 to build and train custom models and Hugging Face 🤗 to fine-tune existing models on custom datasets.
- I'm passionate about teaching 👨‍🏫 and building quality education materials. Here is the [link](https://iitm-pod.slides.com/arunprakash_ai) where I have built some lecture slides for Deep learning. I have been building and shaping course materials 📝 for the [Introduction to LLM course](https://iitm-pod.slides.com/arunprakash_ai/decks/llms) Both these courses are taught by Prof.Mitesh Khapra, at IIT Madras.
- I love Writing [blogs](https://arunprakash-a.github.io/) mostly on technical side, especially for future me 😜. 
- I like Illustrating concepts using animations and interactive apps. Samples in [GeoGebra](https://www.geogebra.org/u/arunprakash_ai)
- I am a Karma Yoga practitioner 🕉️
