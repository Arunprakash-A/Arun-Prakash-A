## About me 
- I'm a deep learning researcher 🔭, currently working with transformer models.
- I use PyTorch 🐍🔦 and Hugging Face 🤗  to build, train, and fine-tune models.
- I'm passionate about teaching 👨‍🏫 and building quality education materials. I have built some lecture slides for the [Deep learning](https://iitm-pod.slides.com/arunprakash_ai/decks/dl)  course. Recently, I have been building and shaping course materials 📝 for the [Introduction to LLM course](https://iitm-pod.slides.com/arunprakash_ai/decks/llms) and [Modern NLP with Hugging Face](https://github.com/Arunprakash-A/Modern-NLP-with-Hugging-Face) All these courses are taught by Prof.Mitesh Khapra, at IIT Madras.
- I love Writing [blogs](https://arunprakash-a.github.io/) mostly on technical side, especially for future me 😜. 
- I like Illustrating concepts using animations and interactive apps. Samples in [GeoGebra](https://www.geogebra.org/u/arunprakash_ai)
- I am a Karma Yoga practitioner 🕉️
